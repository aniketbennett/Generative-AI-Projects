Gemini AI Image App
The Gemini AI Image App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload images and interact with Gemini AI to generate text-based explanations or other responses. By simply providing an image and an optional text prompt, users can receive AI-generated content that explains or modifies the uploaded image.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
Text Prompt: Users can provide an optional text prompt for the AI to consider when generating a response.
AI Explanation: The app uses the Gemini AI model to explain or generate content related to the uploaded image.
Interactive Chat: The app responds in real-time based on user input and image upload.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Streamlit
Gemini API key (for using Gemini AI)
Setup
Prerequisites
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Gemini API key:

Sign up at Gemini AI (or any relevant provider).
Create an API key and store it securely.
In the code, replace your-gemini-api-key with your actual API key:

python
Copy code
os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY'] = 'your-gemini-api-key'
Running the App
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-ai-image-app.git
cd gemini-ai-image-app
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit google-generativeai Pillow
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the app.

How It Works
Text Input: The user can type a prompt in the "Input Prompt" field.
Image Upload: Users upload an image to be analyzed or explained.
AI Response: After the user presses the "Explain me about the image" button, the app sends both the image and prompt (if provided) to the Gemini AI model and displays the generated response.
Example Use Case
Upload an image of a sunset.
Provide a prompt like "Describe the atmosphere of the scene."
Get a detailed response from the AI explaining the sunset in the image.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Streamlit
AI Integration: Gemini AI or Google Generative AI API
Image Handling: Pillow (PIL)
